<p><strong> First Delivery for Final Project - Recycling</strong></p>
<p>For this deliver we created a placeholder of the scenario and background music.

<p><strong> Second Delivery for Final Project - Recycling</strong></p>
<p>For this release we have implemented 4 grabage trucks of different colours to pick up the rubbish. To do this we have implemented the ability to select a truck using the tracker once you are standing on it and it follows us until we are at the point of unselection marked with a red rectangle.
<p>We have also implemented that while we are selecting a truck we can pick up objects of the same colour as the truck by passing over them and these objects will stay inside the truck.
<p>Finally we have also implemented the functionality to unload the truck once we pass over the same coloured rubbish bin as the truck.
<p>We only need to add the different rubbish objects to replace them with the test objects we currently have, add an animation to the factory which is supposed to create the rubbish, and set a victory condition to end the game.
